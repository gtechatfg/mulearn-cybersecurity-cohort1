cybergooys vulnerability assessment

This vulnerability assessment report was conducted on the web application http://testphp.vulnweb.com/. The assessment was conducted using a variety of tools and techniques, including sqlmap,nikito,manually injection  of SQL The assessment identified a number of vulnerabilities, SQL injection. The most severe vulnerability identified was a SQL injection vulnerability that could allow an attacker to inject sql code into the steal information  and steal user details like email password phonenumber.

Introduction

The objective of this vulnerability assessment was to identify and assess the security risks associated with the web application http://testphp.vulnweb.com/. The assessment was conducted in accordance with the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Testing Guide.

Methodology

The following tools and techniques were used to conduct the vulnerability assessment:

* **sqlmap :A tool used for injecting SQL injection and getting the database by columns etc.
* Nikto: A network security scanner that identifies and assesses vulnerabilities in web servers and other network devices.
* **nmap:A network security scanner that identifies and assesses vulnerabilities in web servers and other network devices.

Findings

The following vulnerabilities were identified during the vulnerability assessment:

*Getting database from acart 
*Adding new new images to the poster
*getting id address of the website 


Conclusion

This vulnerability assessment identified a number of security risks associated with the web application http://testphp.vulnweb.com/. The most severe vulnerability identified was a critical XSS vulnerability that could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the web application and steal user cookies or session tokens.
